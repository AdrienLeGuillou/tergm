# Degree-constrained proposals #

Degree-constrained sampling presently has three implementations: 
CondDegreeTetrad, CondDegree (using CondDegreeTetradToggles and 
CondDegreeHexadToggles), and CondDegreeSimple (using 
CondDegreeSimpleTetrad and CondDegreeSingleHexad). It is not clear which 
of them are correct / faster / more efficient. We should, ideally, 
reduce them to one.

# Curved term cutoff #

For now, the cutoff= in gw* functions is a hard bound, not adaptive in 
any way, even if there exist values above it, to keep things simple and 
stable. We may want to improve this later, or at least have the 
initialization functions check if there are values above it.
