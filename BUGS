# Degree-constrained proposals #

Degree-constrained sampling presently has three implementations: 
CondDegreeTetrad, CondDegree (using CondDegreeTetradToggles and 
CondDegreeHexadToggles), and CondDegreeSimple (using 
CondDegreeSimpleTetrad and CondDegreeSingleHexad). It is not clear which 
of them are correct / faster / more efficient. We should, ideally, 
reduce them to one.
