See [`N()`][ergm.multi::N-ergmTerm] term operator in the \pkg{ergm.multi} for details. `lm` formula may reference `.Time` for the network's time index, `.TimeID` for the its index in the network series (where the initial network is 1 and the first modelled network is 2), and `.TimeDelta` for the time elapsed between the network and the immediately previous network in the series.
