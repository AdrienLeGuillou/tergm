\section{CHANGES IN ergm VERSION 2.4}{
  \subsection{SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Here is a significant user-visible change
      
    }
  }
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Implemented "news" feature so users can type 
      \code{news(package="ergm")}.
      
      \item Added "ergm.allstats" function that calculates all possible network
      statistics for a given ergm and network.  The number of possible networks
      grows extremely fast, so this should only be used for small networks.  
      Related function \code{ergm.exact} calculates exact log-likelihood for 
      a particular canonical parameter and a particular ergm.
